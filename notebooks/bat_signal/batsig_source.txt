Bat chirp signal: Digitized 2.5 microsecond echolocation pulse emitted by the Large Brown Bat, Eptesicus Fuscus. 
There are 400 samples; the sampling period was 7 microseconds. 
Download the signal as the file batsig.bin.Z. (The .bin extension does not mean `binary' - rather it simply tricks 
your browser into `save' rather than `display' mode.)
