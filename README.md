## Python examples

The folder ```notebooks``` holds a number of minimal working examples of the methods explored in the benchmarks in the form of Python notebooks.

## MATLAB examples

Inside the directory [```src/methods```](src/methods) there are several folders with the MATLAB implementations, each one named after their corresponding method. There you can find files called  ```mwe_*.m``` with a minimal working example of each method. The MATLAB functions that it are called from the Python-based benchmark always start with ```method_```.
